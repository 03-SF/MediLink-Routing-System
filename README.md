# MediLink-Routing-System
This C++ project, built during my 3rd semester for the Data Structures course, simulates a medicine delivery system using graphs. It applies Prim's Algorithm to construct a Minimum Spanning Tree for cost-efficient network planning, and Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute shortest delivery routes between locations

🚀 Features
Represents delivery locations and their connections using an adjacency matrix.

Utilizes Prim’s Algorithm to build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) that connects all locations with minimal cost.

Applies Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path between any two delivery points.

Interactive console interface for:

Viewing the MST of the network.

Checking the shortest path and cost between locations.

Simulating a medicine delivery request.
