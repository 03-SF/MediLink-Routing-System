# MediLink-Routing-System
This C++ project, built during my 3rd semester for the Data Structures course, simulates a medicine delivery system using graphs. It applies Prim's Algorithm to construct a Minimum Spanning Tree for cost-efficient network planning, and Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute shortest delivery routes between locations
